# Prediction-of-protein-functionality
OBJECTIVE:
The Objective of this project is to handle large dataset.User can input any protein's sequence,the program will predict the functionality of the given protein sequence .
DESCRIPTION:
Internally  Database have 10 domains .Each sequence of domain contains some functionality of the protein which will define the protein â€™s behavior .The objective is  to find the maximum similarity between the stored Domains and Inputed Sequence . Maximum similarity is find by using advanced sequence matching algorithms.
